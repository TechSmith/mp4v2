 *  particular instant in time are colocated within the file. This
 *  eliminates disk seeks during playback of the file which results in
 *  better performance.
 *
 *  There are also two important side effects of MP4Optimize():
 *
 *  First, any free blocks within the mp4 file are eliminated.
 *
 *  Second, as a side effect of the sample interleaving process any media
 *  data chunks that are not actually referenced by the mp4 control
 *  structures are deleted. This is useful if you have called MP4DeleteTrack()
